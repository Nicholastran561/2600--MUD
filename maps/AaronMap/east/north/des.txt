This room is very different from any you have ever seen before. The walls are painted in bright stripes of pink and gold and the floor is covered in thick, shaggy carpet. Above you in the center of the room hangs a disco ball. While this room looks fun, you cannot help but feel like something bad happened here. To the south there is an old door and to the east there is a small hole you can crawl through.
