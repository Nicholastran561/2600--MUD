When you enter this room you immediately hit your head when you try to stand up straight. Sitting down now and massaging the new bruise on the top of your head you look around to see that the ceiling is only about 4 feet tall you hear loud noises that sound like some sort of great machinery working. Towards the east is a short door with a sign that says Safety This Way. To the north there seems to be a small amount of water leaking in. You move towards the south of the room and the noise of the machinery seems to be getting louder. There is another small door on the south wall but this one has a sign that says All Who Enter Shall Perish.
