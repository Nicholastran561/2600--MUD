You find yourself standing in the middle of what seems to be a teenagers bedroom, though not from this era. It seems maybe a few decades old by the posters on the wall. To the west you see a desk and above it are posters for the bands Radiohead, Alice in Chains, Oasis, and REM. Against the north wall is a twin bed and above it are a plethora of Los Angeles Lakers posters. To the south is a typical wooden bedroom door and to the east is an open window you think you could climb out of.
