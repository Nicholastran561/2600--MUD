You struggle to see anything in this room, but after straining your eyes for a bit you realize it is not much of a room at all, but more of a cave. You feel something whisk past your leg and hear scurrying coming from the ceiling. To the north are hanging plastic sheets you could push right through, to the east is a door that says Enter to Win, and to the west is a short door you need to duck to fit through that says Death Lies Ahead.
