You duck through the small door and this time you check to make sure you are not going to hit your head. After standing up you look around and find yourself in a room that looks like the inside of an Ancient Greek temple. All the noise of the machinery has seemingly stopped. There is a long red carpet with gold trim that leads towards a pedestal at the end of the long room and you cannot make out what, but there is something sitting on it. You make your way toward the pedestal and once you reach it you can finally make out what is sitting there. Upon the pedestal sits a bucket filled with ice and inside sits a single bottle. You take out the can and see that it is a bottle of root beer, but not just any root beer, it is the legendary Zeus root beer that grants any who drinks it the power to rule the universe.
