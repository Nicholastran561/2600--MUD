After entering this room you immediately wish you hadn’t. The walls all look as though they’re spinning at a million miles per hour and you feel dizzier than you ever have. As you get closer and closer to vomiting you look around for ways out of here. To what you think is east is a small hole you could crawl through, to what you’re pretty sure is west is a door, and to the what could be north you see a shape that is maybe a door but you’re not totally certain.
