This room, if it can even be called that, is about the size of a broom closet and you find yourself struggling to move around. The west wall is completely made of glass and looks out to a scene you would see at an aquarium. Completely filled with water you can see many different sea creatures swimming around outside the glass wall. Hopefully the glass is sturdy. To the east is what looks like a classroom door, to the north is a narrow gap, and to the south is just sheets of plastic that you could push right through.
